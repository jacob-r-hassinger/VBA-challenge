# VBA-challenge

This VBA script runs through multiple years of stock trading data. The data was organized by year on multiple sheets. Within each sheet, the stocks were organized by their Ticker value and tracked the opening, high, low, and closing share values per day, as well as the total volume of shares traded that day. The VBA script tracked the changes in price and volume over the year and produced a range of summary data. 
With the summary range, the VBA script then prepared a second summary range to display the stock with the greatest percentage increase and decrease, and the stock with the largest volume of stocks traded over the year.
